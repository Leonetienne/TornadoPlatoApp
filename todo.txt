OPTIMIZATIONS:

	GAME ENGINE:
	- Support culling distances for light sources and mesh renderers
	- Adding new components to worldObjects should be using smart pointers instead.
	    The current templated solution is producing problems on linux.
	    This way the components could be instantiated on user-side, without having to be freed.

	RENDERING ENGINE:
	Cull lights if distance to camera is > farclip + intensity*13


FEATURES:

ORGANIZATION:
	Put each project into a designated namespace. Then rename Plato:PCollider, PTrapazoidPrismCollider back to without P.
	Ideas for namespaces: tornadoGL, plato, eule
