OPTIMIZATIONS:

	GAME ENGINE:
	Support culling distances for light sources and mesh renderers

	RENDERING ENGINE:
	Cull lights if distance to camera is > farclip + intensity*13


FEATURES:
	SIMPLE LIGHT SOURCES:
		Attribute: Box boundingBox
			If boundingBox is set, this light source should only cast light within the box.
			User story: We want to use a shadowless light to light a house from the inside.
				    We want to avoid the light casting brightness onto objects outside the house.
			            The house would be the bounding box.

ORGANIZATION:
	Split Quaternion, Vectors, Matrices, and the Math util into its own library/project. They will be used by multiple higher layers.
	Why should the physics engine depend on the graphics engine just to use its matrices and vectors?
