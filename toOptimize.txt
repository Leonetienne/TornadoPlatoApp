GAME ENGINE:
Support culling distances for light sources and mesh renderers

RENDERING ENGINE:
Cull lights if distance to camera is > farclip + intensity*13

LightingEngine should create a mapping between each render triangle and light source. Flag a triangle-lightsource relationship as "false",
if every triangle vertex is farther away from the light source than lightsource.intensity*13. If a triangle-lightsource relationship is "false",
don't even call the lightsource computation method on this triangle
